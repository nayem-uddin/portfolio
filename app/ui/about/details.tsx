      I am Nayem Uddin Biswas, a passionate and dedicated full-stack developer
      from Narayanganj, Bangladesh. I build responsive, performance-optimized,
      and user-friendly UIs using several modern UI libraries and frameworks,
      including Next.js, React.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and
      shadcn/ui. In addition, I have internship experience in developing backend
      servers with the abilities to perform secure cross-platform data exchange
      using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and Socket.IO. I have hands-on
      experience in MySQL, and currently, I am learning PostgreSQL. Since the
      beginning of my web development journey, I have been working with
      JavaScript. But, as an attempt to get used to the latest web technologies,
      I have started learning about and working with TypeScript. Besides, I try
      to follow the best practices and principles of software development,
      including SOLID principles, to ensure the scalability and modularity of
      the web projects.
